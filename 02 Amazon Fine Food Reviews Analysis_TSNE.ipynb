      "Wow So far two two star reviews One obviously had no idea what they were ordering the other wants crispy cookies Hey I am sorry but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look before ordering br br These are chocolate oatmeal cookies If you do not like that combination do not order this type of cookie I find the combo quite nice really The oatmeal sort of calms the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut type consistency Now let is also remember that tastes differ so I have given my opinion br br Then these are soft chewy cookies as advertised They are not crispy cookies or the blurb would say crispy rather than chewy I happen to like raw cookie dough however I do not see where these taste like raw cookie dough Both are soft however so is this the confusion And yes they stick together Soft cookies tend to do that They are not individually wrapped which would add to the cost Oh yeah chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet br br So if you want something hard and crisp I suggest Nabiso is Ginger Snaps If you want a cookie that is soft chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal give these a try I am here to place my second order \n"
